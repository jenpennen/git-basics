# Git Branching Overview

## Branches

When you make a commit in Git, each commit gets a unique hash that identifies it, along with some other information. Each commit also points to at least one preceding commit, called its parent.

Branches play a crucial role in Git. In collaborative coding projects, it's common to work on different features or aspects of the project at the same time. This is where branches become useful.

A branch acts like an alternate timeline within the project. It allows us to create isolated environments to experiment and develop multiple ideas simultaneously. Most importantly, **changes made in one branch won't affect others unless they are merged together**.
