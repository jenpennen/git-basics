# Difference between Git and Github

## Git

Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don't need to register for an account nor the internet. You can use Git without ever touching Github.

## Github

Github is a web service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people. You need to make an account to use Github. It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.

## Why did I write this on a separate file?

Trust me, I've written about this on paper and people have always bypassed it. It's important to know the difference between the two! Github is a tool built for Git users!
