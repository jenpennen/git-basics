# A Little Bit of Git History

## Linus Torvald

He's a software engineer and creator behind Linux and Git. He was frustrated with the available version control systems(vcs) because they were slow, close-sources, and usually paid, while working on Linux. (this was back in 2005)

## Linux

Before git, Linux was using a different vcs called BitKeeper - basically did what Git does. But the owners of BitKeeper established a paywall and frustrated Linus. The free options weren't good enough- didn't have the features that BitKeeper had that Linus needed, so he built one himself.

## Git

Linus wanted a vcs that was fast and free, unlike the existing tools. He actually wrote most of the basic git funtionality in a few days (which is a lot less than the time I'm taking to learning Git ... :,D)

Anyways, the first official Git release came a couple months later (still very impressive considering it's been a few years since I've touched Git and I'm still learning as I go lol) and more than 90% of developers use Git now. Crazy.

## Behind the Name

According to the Git docs, the name means three different things deending on your mood:

- a random three-letter combo that is pronouncable and not used by any common UNIX command
- "global info tracker"
- "Goddamn idiotic truckload of shit": great for when it breaks :)

## Who uses Git?

Obviously, engineers and coders. It's a must have skill.

But it's not just for tech roles. A huge reason I started this repo was that I needed git a lot in my work as a product designer at Retune, and so did my other designer and writer friends. It's safe to say, many tech adjacent roles also learn Git to better collaborate with their tech coworkers.

Scientists use git to manage code, data sets, and more.

_But Also_ The government also uses git and github to draft out laws. Washington DC City council uses Git and Github to publish laws, and citizens can even collaborate on it to fix typos and such!

to learn more about the different governments that use github (built on top of git).

## tldr Anyone can use Git

I'm literally using git+ github to store git knowledge I might forget later on. But there's a lot of creative ways to use git, some examples written above this section. It a great way to track both small and large changes made over time.
