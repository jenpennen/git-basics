# Git Basics

Welcome. This is a _highly serious_ and _very professional_ project where I learn the arcane rituals of Git, one typo at a time. If you're here looking for groundbreaking code, you might want to turn around - because this is where I just write about Git ... and then commit it. &#9786;

## What's This All About?

This repo exists solely for the purpose of me mastering Git like a pro. Or at least trying to.

> [!Note]
> This is just a little stash of Git and Github basics to kick my development workflow into gear. If you're craving the full, unabridged Git experience, complete with all the obscure options and features, dive into the **Git [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)** - it's a real page-turner!

## How to Contribute

Please don't. If you fix things, it will ruin the mystique of my unpolished Git skills. **_But_** if you insist, submit a PR with the subject: `You Git This Wrong, Let Me Help`. I will either:

- Accept it and pretend I did it all along.
- Ignore it and go back to merging conflicts I created myself.

## License

There is no license. It's not that serious. &#9786;
