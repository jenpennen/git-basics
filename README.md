# Git Basics

Welcome. This is a _highly seriously_ and _very professional_ project where I learn the arcane rituals of Git, one typo at a time. If you're here looking for groundbreaking code, you might want to turn around - because this is where I just write about Git ... and then commit it. :)

## What's This All About?

This repo exists solely for the purpose of me mastering Git like a pro. Or at least trying to.

## Features (Kinda)

- **Blame Shifting**: Pushing mysterious bugs to the repo and pretending they were always there. It's never my fault. It's Git's fault.
- **Branching Like a Pro** : Watch as I create more branches than a tree and then forget what each one does. : )
- **Commitment Issues** : Why settle for one commit when you can --amend everything five times?
- **Merge Mayhem** : Here's where conflicts come to party. I resolve them eventually. Sometimes with a good old-fashioned git reset --hard (don't judge me).

## Commands I Keep Forgetting :-D

Here are the Git commands I _should_ remember but always have to Google.

- git stash (aka I'll deal with you later)
- git rebase (aka I hope I know what I'm doing)
- git pull --rebase (aka Just take it all, Git, take it)
- git reset --hard HEAD (aka Let's pretend that didn't happen...)

## How to Contribute

Please don't. If you fix things, it will ruin the mystique of my unpolished Git skills. _But_ if you insist, submit a PR with the subject: You Git This Wrong, Let Me Help. I will either:

- Accept it and pretend I did it all along.
- Ignore it and go back to merging conflicts I created myself.

## License

There is no license. It's not that serious.
