# Git Basics

Welcome. This is a _highly serious_ and _very professional_ project where I learn the arcane rituals of Git, one typo at a time. If you're here looking for groundbreaking code, you might want to turn around - because this is where I just write about Git ... and then commit it. &#9786;

## How to Contribute

Please don't. If you fix things, it will ruin the mystique of my unpolished Git skills. _But_ if you insist, submit a PR with the subject: `You Git This Wrong, Let Me Help`. I will either:

- Accept it and pretend I did it all along.
- Ignore it and go back to merging conflicts I created myself.

## License

There is no license. It's not that serious. &#9786;
