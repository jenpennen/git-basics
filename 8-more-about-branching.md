# Branching Commands

## Viewing Branches

To view your existing branches, use the command `git branch`:

```
> git branch
OUTPUT:
* main
(END)
```

The default branch in most git repository is `main`, but this can be configured (more on that later). The `*` (asterisk) represents the branch you're currently on. If you're in a text editor viewing branches, type `:q` to exit.

## Creating New Branches

To create a new branch based on the current `HEAD`, use `git branch <branch-name>`. This only creates the branch and doesn't switch you to it (`HEAD` stays the same).

```
> git branch songs
```

## Switching Branches

After creating a new branch, switch to it using `git switch <branch-name>`.
Example:

```
> git branch songs # creates the 'songs' branch
> git switch songs # switches to the 'songs' branch
OUTPUT: Switched to branch 'songs'
```

Now, `HEAD` will now point to the `songs` branch instead of `main`. You can confirm this by checking `git log` and `git status`

```
> git switch songs
OUTPUT:
On branch songs
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/songs'.

> git log
OUTPUT:
commit 7ec8c8431b5c2cc0536f7be935efa834fb044be7 (HEAD -> songs, origin/songs)
```

**NOTE:** If you've made changes on a branch, you need to **commit or stash** them before switching to another branch (more on this later).

## `git stash`

We'll cover this in more depth in the merging sections. If you donâ€™t stash your changes, any files specific to that branch will carry over when you switch to another branch. In cases of conflicts, Git will alert you. As a best practice, always commit or stash your changes before switching branches.

```
> git stash
```

## Creating AND Switching

To create AND switch to a new branch in a single step, use the `-c` flag with `git switch`. The `-c` stands for "create".

```
# git switch -c <branch-name>
> git switch -c hobbies
```

## Another Way of Switching: `git checkout`

Historically, `git checkout <branch-name>` was used to switch branches, and it still works. However, since checkout has several other functions, the simpler `git switch` command was introduced specifically for switching branches. Older tutorials may use `git checkout`, but both commands work for this purpose.

While `git checkout` can be used for other tasks like restoring files, we'll focus on branch switching here. Personally, I prefer using `git switch` as it is more straightforward and intended specifically for switching branches.
