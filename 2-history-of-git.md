# A Brief History of Git

## Linus Torvalds

Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux and Git, was frustrated with the available version control systems (VCS) at the time. While working on Linux (back in 2005), he found the existing tools to be slow, close-sources, and often required payment (paywalled).

## Linux

Before Git, the Linux project used a VCS called BitKeeper, which worked similarly to Git. However, when BitKeeper's owners introduced a paywall, it frustrated Linus. The free alternatives weren't powerful enough and lacked the features he needed. So, he decided to create his own system.

## Git

Linus wanted a fast and free VCS, unlike the ones that existed at the time. He actually wrote most of Git’s core functionality in just a few days (which is much quicker than the time it's taking me to learn Git, haha). The first official Git release came a couple of months later, which is still impressive considering it's been years since I first touched Git, and I’m still learning. Today, more than 90% of developers use Git. Pretty wild!

## Where the Name Git Came From

According to the Git documentation, the name "Git" can mean different things depending on your mood:

- A random, pronounceable three-letter combination not used by any common UNIX commands
- "Global info tracker"
- "Goddamn idiotic truckload of shit" (perfect for when things go wrong!)

## Who uses Git?

Obviously, engineers and coders rely heavily on Git—it’s a must-have skill.

But it’s not limited to tech roles. I started using Git frequently during my time as a product designer at Retune, and many of my designer and writer colleagues have adopted it too. So, tech-adjacent roles often learn Git to collaborate more effectively with their technical teams.

Scientists also use Git to manage code, datasets, and other materials.

_Even_ government agencies use Git and GitHub for drafting laws. For example, Washington D.C.'s City Council publishes laws on GitHub, allowing citizens to contribute by fixing typos and more!

You can check out the link here: `https://government.github.com/community/`
to learn more about the different governments that use github, which is built on top of Git (more on this later).

## TLDR: Anyone can use Git

I’m using Git and GitHub to store knowledge I might forget later on. There are plenty of creative ways to use Git, from tracking small edits to managing large projects, as shown in the examples above. It’s a great tool for tracking changes over time.
